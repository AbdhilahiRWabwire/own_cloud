Enhancement: Access from document provider independent from locking methods

Previously, files of ownCloud accounts couldn't be accessed from document provider or
Android native file explorer when there was a lock set in the app. Now, a new preference has been
added to allow the access when the app is locked which was only enabled if at least one
locking method was activated. Now, it has changes to "Lock access from document provider"
and is independent from locking methods, just like another preference.
